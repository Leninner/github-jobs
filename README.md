<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67031243/161645142-b311aec1-6f8f-4937-a4e0-03d42db4c995.png)

This project is really simple. It's a web app that shows you the latest jobs from Jooble.com. You can use it to find the best job for you.

The Demo is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), it´s free to try. Look out for the [Demo](https://github-jobs-tech.vercel.app/) and the [Solution](https://github-jobs-tech.vercel.app/).

The experince with this project was really good. I learned a lot about pagination, how to use the API and how to use the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework. I advice you to try it out.

I hope you enjoy it!
